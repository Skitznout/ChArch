A set of scripts to manage chroot containers on Linux.

# Features
- Low Learning Curve. Even Linux noobs will have an easy time with ChArch.
- Portable. Take your rootfs instances with you on an external drive.
- Fast. ChArch uses raw filesystems instead of loopback devices.
- Easy. ChArch can configure an entire rootfs instance in less than a minute (YMMV).
- Compatible. ChArch uses relatively few dependencies and Magisk BusyBox is used as a fallback for Android devices.
- Seamless. ChArch supports multiple running rootfs instances at the same time, and even in the background.
